LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell U_clock_devider/count[31]_i_3__0, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) U_clock_devider/count_reg[0]/CLR, U_clock_devider/count_reg[10]/CLR,
U_clock_devider/count_reg[11]/CLR, U_clock_devider/count_reg[12]/CLR,
U_clock_devider/count_reg[13]/CLR, U_clock_devider/count_reg[14]/CLR,
U_clock_devider/count_reg[15]/CLR, U_clock_devider/count_reg[16]/CLR,
U_clock_devider/count_reg[17]/CLR, U_clock_devider/count_reg[18]/CLR,
U_clock_devider/count_reg[19]/CLR, U_clock_devider/count_reg[1]/CLR,
U_clock_devider/count_reg[20]/CLR, U_clock_devider/count_reg[21]/CLR,
U_clock_devider/count_reg[22]/CLR (the first 15 of 33 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
